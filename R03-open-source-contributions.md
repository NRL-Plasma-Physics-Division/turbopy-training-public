Reflection 03: Contributing to Open Source
==========================================

The full benefits of open source are realized when we all give as much (or more) as we receive. For example, if you find yourself using a certain Python package a lot, perhaps you could check out the repo and see if there's an issue tagged `good first issue` that you could help to address. Or, if you run into a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) that's unanswered when you are researching how to solve a problem, perhaps you could bookmark it and come back to answer it once you figure out the solution.

For this reflection exercise, try to do one of the following:
1. find an issue on a non-turboPy-related repo and contribute to its resolution
2. upvote an answer on StackOverflow (if you have enough rep)
3. if you don't have the rep to upvote an answer on StackOverflow, ask (or answer) a question (see [How do I ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) before asking!)

Questions
=========
1. What do you think about open source software?
2. Do you prefer to use open source or commercial software? (Maybe "it depends"!)
3. Do you see yourself contributing to open source software in the future? If so, in what way?
