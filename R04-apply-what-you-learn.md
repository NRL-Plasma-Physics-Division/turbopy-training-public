Reflection 04: Applying What You've Learned
===========================================
You will be learning a lot of new things this summer and sharpening some skills you brought to the internship. 
This internship will very likely lead other opportunities over the next several years.
Also, by the end of the summer, you will have interacted with many different professionals through emails, chats, and calls,
as well as completed progress reports, filled out timecards, and more.
These soft and professional skills help make you a well-rounded individual and are a great asset.  

For this exercise, reflect on one or more of the following:  
1. technical skills you came into the internship with that have been improved;
2. soft skills that have improved (e.g. communications, time management, project management);
3. new technical skills that you have picked up (e.g. specific programming skills).

Questions
=========
1. How can you apply your new skills or improve upon them future applications?
2. What are some specific areas you know you want to improve? (cliche but still good to think about)
