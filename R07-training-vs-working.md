Reflection 07: Learn by Doing vs. Do After Learning
===============================
During this internship, the mentors tried to strike a balance between training
and "real work". In this reflection that balance will be examined.

Remember that it is okay to constructively criticize the formatting of the
project. This reflection will be used to improve the program in the future.

Questions
=========
1. Do you feel that the training section of the internship lasted too long? Too short? Just right? Explain.
2. Are there any ways that you would have changed the training section of the project? If so, what/how? If not, what do you think went really well?
3. How do you learn most effectively?
4. How has working 100% virtually affected your capacity to learn? Is there anything that could have been done to help you work from home?

Open Response
=============
This section is not required, but is the place for any remarks that do not fit
with the questions above.
