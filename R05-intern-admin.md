Reflection 05: Intern Admin Role
===============================
The intern administrator role is (and has been) used to provide an intern with
the chance to gain experience managing a GitHub repository, including helping
to review and merge code. It should be noted, however, that there is no formal
definition of the jobs that the intern administrator completes so what each
intern does during their time with the role is dependant on their own prerogative.

For Reflection 05 please consider completing the questions in two parts: one part
while you are the intern admin, and one while you are not (either before or after).
This is not required, but might help to organize reflections for future reference.

Questions
=========
1. What do you think should be the role of the intern administrator? Does this align with what you did during your time as intern administrator?
2. Do you have any recommendations for how to improve this role in the future? If so, what? If not, what did you enjoy about the role?

Open Response
=============
This section is not required, but is the place for any remarks that do not fit
with the questions above.
