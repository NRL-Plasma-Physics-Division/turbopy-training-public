Reflection 01: Initial Thoughts
===============================

Throughout your internship, you will be asked to write short reflections on your experience.
We will provide you with a topic and/or one or more questions for each writing, but feel free to write about anything
relevant to your experience in the turboPy Intern Project. If you feel comfortable sharing your reflective writing with 
the team, please add it to the `R01` folder
in markdown format in a file named `R01-lastname.md`. (fork->clone->commit->pull request)

Questions
=========
1. What has prepared are you to tackle the turboPy Intern Project? 
   This could include courses (math, physics, computer science) or other prior experiences.
2. What are your initial impressions of the project, including the format (i.e. GitHub, 100% remote work,
   mix of synchronous and asynchronous communications)?
