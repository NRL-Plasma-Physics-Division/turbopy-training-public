Introduction to Python
======================

The "Installing Python" lesson on RealPython.com does not mention [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and instead walks you through installing a base
distribution of Python on Windows, Mac, or Linux.  Since we will be using Anaconda Python 
extensively, it is probably best that you go ahead and install it now and begin becoming 
familiar with the various tools and packages present in it.  Look for opportunities during your
learning to experiment with `conda`, Navigator, and Jupyter Notebooks, all of which come
with Anaconda Python. You could, in fact, skip installing Python as described in the RealPython 
lesson and only use Anaconda Python.

Prep
----
1. Complete the RealPython [Intro to Python Learning Path](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python3-introduction/).
2. Read [Getting Started with Anaconda Python](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/), including [Getting Started with Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started), [Getting Started with conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html), and [Jupyter Notebook Beginner's Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Seminar Goals
-------------
Review basic Python concepts and how they apply to the internship. Demo of creating and using the turboPy conda
environment.

Homework
--------
1. Install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Create, activate, and use a conda environment for a simple program.
3. Create a python file in T01 named T01-lastname that prints out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence where n is a user input. Throw an error if n is negative.

Notes
-----
- Consider creating one or more "Training" Jupyter Notebooks for keeping notes from all
  of your training. You can use the markdown feature to add notes. This will also allow 
  you to save commonly used commands.
- `conda` environments are a great way to manage a development environment. For example, if you use the
  `turboPy` conda environment when developing turboPy code, you know **exactly** which version of 
  a given package that you are using.
