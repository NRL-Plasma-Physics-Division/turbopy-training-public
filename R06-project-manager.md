Reflection 06: Intern Project Manager Role
===============================
The main job of the project manager is to keep track of open projects and ensure
that operations are running smoothly. This includes keeping in touch with people, 
asking for updates on progress, and offering helpful assistance if needed.

For Reflection 06 please consider completing the questions in two parts: one part
while you are the project manager, and one while you are not (either before or after).
This is not required, but might help to organize reflections for future reference.

Questions
=========
1. Is having a project manager beneficial to your workflow?
2. Did you ever feel that the project manager was annoying/counter-productive? If so, how could the position be less so in the future? (Don't worry, we can all take some constructive criticism, though please try to keep it constructive)
3. During your time as project manager, how did you complete your job? (ie. spreadsheets, calendars, google reminders, pen & paper, etc.)

Open Response
=============
This section is not required, but is the place for any remarks that do not fit
with the questions above.
