Reflection 02: Challenges
=========================

In research (as in life), you will face many challenges. This is especially true this summer as
we are all learning to work effectively in a 100% telework environment.

Questions
=========
1.  What challenges have you encountered so far in this remote internship? 
2.  Have you been successful at overcoming them?  Do you have any "lessons learned" that you would 
    want to share at this point?
