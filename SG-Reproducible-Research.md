Seminar Goals
-------------
Learn about the concepts behind reproducible research. Discuss what we are already doing right and how we can improve with regards to reproducibility.

Homework
--------
Try to identify at least one area in which we can improve our approach to reproducibility and add it to the notes section or share during the seminar. *Extra credit:* create an issue related to improving our approach to reproducibility.
