# turboPy-training
Plan, execute, and share materials for the NRL turboPy Intern Project Seminars, Summer 2020.

## Seminar Workflow

1. Lead mentor creates Teams seminar calendar invite and creates the markdown file for the seminar (`T00/SA-seminar-name.md`) in root of `turboPy-training` (this) repo from `templates/SEMINAR.md`. (Use T + double-digit number (e.g. `T00`, `T01`...) prefix for git and Python training seminars and `S` + letter prefix (e.g. `SA`, `SB`...) for other types of seminars in filename of markdown file.)
2. Lead intern creates issue in this repo and adds a card to [`turboPy-training` project](https://github.com/orgs/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/projects/1) `to do` column using the same title as the markdown file (See `00 Git and Github Training issue` for an example.)
3. First intern to review the material for the seminar moves card to [project](https://github.com/orgs/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/projects/1) `in progress` column.
4. Interns do prep work and homework (if required) outlined in the markdown file, including pull request to update notes and adding suggested changes/bugs to issue improving the activity.
5. Interns and mentors participate in seminar on Teams and any related activities.
6. Interns and mentors resolve any suggestions/bugs in issue.
7. Each intern reacts to initial comment on issue with :tada: emoji when complete with the lesson.
8. Last intern to complete the lesson moves card to [project](https://github.com/orgs/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/projects/1) `done` column, closing out the seminar and issue.

## Reflective Writing

Throughout your internship, you will be asked to write short reflections on your experience. We will provide you with a topic and/or one or more questions for each writing, but feel free to write about anything relevant to your experience. If you feel comfortable sharing your reflective writing with the team, please add it to the appropriate folder in markdown format in a file named `RXX-lastname.md`. See `templates/REFLECTION.md` for the template.
